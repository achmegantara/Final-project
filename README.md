### Multi-Dimensional Scaling Method for Tracking Teenager Group Activity on Crowded Place in Real-Time Based on Data Sensor of Mobile Device

_**Preliminary**_ <br> 
we as humans do many activities every day. In the industrial revolution 4.0 and Society 5.0, human behaviour or activities data became very important data, because from these data we can analyze many things to make a decision in the future. So, based on that reason i want to make some system that can collect the data about human activity. <br>

In my system, i used mobile device (smartphone) as an object in my research. why i used smartphone? because at this time, there are many kinds of sensors found on smartphones, but i will not use it all. <br>

There are 3 sensors that i use, i.e.
* Accelerometer sensor
* Accelerometer linear sensor
* Orientation sensor <br>
